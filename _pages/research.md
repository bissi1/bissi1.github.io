## Interdisciplinary Research Overview

My primary research interest is advancing data-driven decision-making under uncertainty, with a particular focus on two-stage stochastic optimization. My approach balances theoretical novelty with impact-based application, addressing complex societal and environmental challenges via large-scale mathematical models. These models often require the development of specialized algorithms to enable computationally efficient solutions. 

My theoretical research is motivated by two key themes:

- ** Chance-constrained optimization**: Designing systems systems resilient to extreme risk conditions. I develop algorithms and approximations that are computationally tractable yet ensuring the critical systems remains safeguarded against rare but catastrophic disruptions. 

- ** Optimality conditions of fairness**: I am interested in different axiomatic definitions of fairness and continuous or discrete optimization models that achieve those. For this, I explore the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the optimization models.

My interdisciplinary research is motivated by three key applications:

- **Energy Systems**  
  Designing resilient and sustainable energy infrastructures capable of withstanding uncertain demand, supply fluctuations, and extreme weather events.

- **Pandemic Response**  
  Developing data-driven models to guide healthcare policy, optimize resource allocation, and ensure fairness in the distribution of scarce medical supplies.

- **Sustainable Waste Management**  
  Optimizing the placement of recycling centers and waste processing facilities to minimize environmental impact and reduce logistical costs.

A unique aspect of my approach is modeling **subjective human behavior** within the decision-making process. This adds a layer of complexity and realism to my models, bridging the gap between mathematical rigor and human-centric decision-making.
