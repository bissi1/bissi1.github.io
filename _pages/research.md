## Interdisciplinary Research Overview

My primary research interest is advancing data-driven decision-making under uncertainty, with a particular focus on two-stage stochastic optimization. My approach balances theoretical novelty with impact-based application, addressing complex societal and environmental challenges via large-scale mathematical models. These models often require the development of specialized algorithms to enable computationally efficient solutions. 

Chance-constrained optimization, where the goal is to design systems systems resilient to extreme risk conditions, is one of my key focus areas. I develop algorithms and heuristics that are computationally tractable ensuring the critical systems remainds safeguarded against rare but catastrophic disruptions.
