I am always interested in working with **motivated students** and **postdoctoral researchers** looking for engaging research opportunities. Whether you’re looking for a BSc or MSc **thesis topic** (*Bachelorarbeit* or *Masterarbeit*), a *semester or summer project*, or a *PhD/postdoc* position, there are opportunities to contribute to impactful research both in person and online under my guidance.  

Over the years, I have supervised exceptional BSc, MSc, PhD students, and postdocs, nearly all of whom published their work in high-quality operations research (OR) journals early in their careers. Examples of past thesis topics and corresponding publications are provided on my <a href="/publications/" style="text-decoration: none;">Publications</a> page.

## Research Focus Areas

I welcome topics in quantitative disciplines, especially **discrete optimization**, with applications in: sustainability, waste management, infectious disease outbreaks, artificial intelligence (AI), or energy management. Other topics are also possible. If you are interested in joining my team, please send me an email with your CV and transcript. 

If you are highly talented and demonstrate exceptional potential, funding options may be available to support your research (e.g., the Commonwealth Scholarship or the Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship).

## Research Opportunities

### Key Requirements
A strong ***technical background*** is expected, as evidenced by ***excellent grades*** in relevant courses. Most importantly, you should have a willingness to work hard and a passion for research.

### PhD Positions
If you're interested in pursuing a PhD in OR with me at the University of Southampton, please apply directly through the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/apply"> University’s website</a>. As the Postgraduate Research Coordinator for the OR group, I will evaluate your application.

### Postdoc Positions
A short postdoc position funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation) is currently available with me for research on stochastic optimization models for the allocation of critical resources during pandemics. Strong experience in discrete optimization is required and informal inquiries are welcome.
