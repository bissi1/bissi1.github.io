Beyond my primary research interests, I am passionate about introducing *mathematical optimization* and, more broadly, *STEM* disciplines to the public. I believe that employing a conversational tone, while maintaining scientific rigor, makes complex concepts more accessible and engaging. This approach allows mathematics to be appreciated not only as a field of technical inquiry but as a lens to view the world around us.

I have published several *educational*, *recreational*, and *pedagogical* works, following peer review, on topics such as history of mathematicians, mathematical monuments, mathematics education, and just mathematics in daily life. These works, published in academic yet approachable journals, demonstrate the explainability of mathematics without relying heavily on jargon.

## Selected Educational Publications

- Singh, B. (2024). “A mathematical programming approach for Mongolia’s ‘The Four Strongest’ puzzle.” *INFORMS Transactions on Education*.
- Singh, B., & Akbulut, Y. (2024). “Promoting mathematics via banknotes: two examples from Turkey.” *British Journal for the History of Mathematics*.
  - Featured on the printed volume's front-page.
- Singh, B. (2022). “A large controversy from a small town: Johann Georg von Soldner of Feuchtwangen.” *The Mathematical Intelligencer*.
- Singh, B. (2019). “Popov, Berg, Sokolov: A street with three plaques.” *The Mathematical Intelligencer*.
- Singh, B. (2016). “Reminiscences of two evenings with Dmitry Borisovich Gnedenko.” *The Mathematical Intelligencer*.

## Editorial Contributions

- Faculty Advisor: *OR/MS Tomorrow* student magazine, INFORMS. 
  - I particularly encourage students to contribute engaging articles.
- Editorial Board Member: INFORMS History and Traditions Committee.
  - As part of this committee, we published several essays documenting the history of mathematical optimization. These essays, featuring interviews and insights from eminent personalities, are maintained by INFORMS:
    - *Brief History of Optimization and Mathematical Programming*
    - *Development of Operations Research in the Soviet Union*
    - *Center for Operations Research and Economics (CORE), Université catholique de Louvain*
    - *University of Texas*
    - *History of OR Excellence: Chemical and Petroleum*

## Poetry

Occasionally, I write poetry in English, blending my creative interests with mathematical themes. Like my academic work, these poems are also published following peer review:

- Singh, B. (2023). “Bicycle.” *Sikh Formations: Religion, Culture, and Theory*. (Q1 ranked)
- Singh, B. (2009). “I never asked them.” *Indian Literature*. (India's oldest English-language poetry journal)
