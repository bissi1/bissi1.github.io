## Research Overview

My research focuses on **stochastic optimization**, **applied probability**, and **mathematical modeling** for complex engineering and economic systems. I develop **novel algorithms** and **decision support tools** for uncertain, high‑dimensional problems in energy, logistics, and telecommunications.
