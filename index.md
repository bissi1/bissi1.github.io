I am Bismark Singh, an Associate Professor in the Operational Research group at the School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Southampton, UK. 

My academic foundation is rooted in an interdisciplinary quantitative data-science background. I have a habilitation in mathematics from the Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg, Germany.  I earned my PhD and Master's degrees in operations research from The University of Texas at Austin, US, where I worked under the guidance of David Morton (optimization) and Lauren Meyers (biology). During my time there, I also completed a portfolio in scientific computation. My undergraduate journey began at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, India, where I graduated in chemical engineering.  <a href="/cv/" style="text-decoration: none;">Short CV â†’</a>

In 2024-25, I am a visiting professor at TU Dresden, Germany via their <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/bu/wirtschaft/die-fakultaet/news/auszeichnung-von-associate-professor-bismark-singh-als-distinguished-research-fellow" style="text-decoration: none;">Distinguished Research Fellowship</a>.

I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://www.modus.uni-bayreuth.de/en/members/application-team/Singh/index.php" style="text-decoration: none;">Research Center for Modeling and Simulation (MODUS)</a> at the University of Bayreuth, Germany.

I am the winner of the Mathematics 2023 <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/mathematics/awards/2137" style="text-decoration: none;">Young Investigator Award</a>. 

My research centers on ***data-driven decision-making under uncertainty***, with a particular focus on discrete stochastic optimization models. From formulating these models to developing novel algorithms and real-world applications, I advance mathematical decision-making in complex and uncertain environments. Stay turned for my upcoming book, to be published by Springer, on this subject!

My research has been funded by, among others, the German Research Foundation (DFG), the Horizon 2020 program, and the US Department of Energy's LDRD program (see left). <a href="/research/" style="text-decoration: none;">Explore My Research â†’</a>
